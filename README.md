## Description

Kasa, a leader in apartment rentals between individuals, is undergoing a major overhaul of its web platform. This freelance front-end development project aims to recreate the platform using modern technologies. The new Kasa platform will utilize React and React Router on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end, offering responsive design based on Figma mockups.

## Design Guidelines

For a realistic preview of the application's design and interface, refer to the Figma mockups provided by the designer. Component logic has been structured in Figma, making it easier for React development. Necessary resources, including icons and logos, can be exported directly from the mockups.

Prototype the site using available interactive prototypes to observe expected animations, especially for dropdown menus (Collapse).

## Functionality

### Gallery Component Behavior

- When the user is on the first image and clicks "Previous Image," the gallery displays the last image.
- Similarly, when the displayed image is the last one, clicking "Next Image" reveals the first image.
- If there's only one image, the "Next" and "Previous" buttons and numbering won't appear.
- The gallery's height should remain consistent as indicated in the Figma mockup. Images will be cropped and centered within the frame.

### Collapse Behavior

- Collapses are closed by default upon page initialization.
- When a Collapse is open, clicking it closes it.
- Conversely, clicking a closed Collapse opens it.
